## Controls
### Crave Smash

### Not So Tasty
Click on a fruit and drag to nearby, similar fruit to form a fruit chain. Lift up once 2 or more fruits have been chained together to clear them off the board. Secret tiles will be revealed in the background when a fruit chain is matched overtop of them. Once all parts of each secret tile have been revealed from matches, you win!

### Match and Catch
Tap cards to flip them over. Once two cards are flipped over, they are checked to make sure they match. If they do not match, they are flipped back over. Once all cards are flipped over in matching pairs, you win!
